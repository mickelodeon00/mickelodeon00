### Hello, I'm Micheal!

I'm a passionate web developer with a strong background in industrial mathematics. My journey into coding began during my studies, and I've since immersed myself in the world of web development.

### Skills

- **Front-end:** React.js, Next.js, Typescript 
- **Back-end:** Express
- **Database:** MongoDB, Supabase 

### Current Project

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable, user-centric applications. Recently, I contributed to Vetlep, a microfinance web application designed to streamline loan processing, customer management, and financial operations. I also worked on the Valdymas College Dashboard, a modern academic dashboard for managing student records, courses, and internal processes.

My stack includes React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with additional experience in tools like Tailwind CSS, Cloudinary, and Material UI. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering solutions that solve real-world problems.

I'm open to junior developer roles, collaborations, and freelance opportunitiesâ€”feel free to explore my projects and connect!
